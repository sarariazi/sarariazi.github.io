<h1> About Me </h1>

I am a visting assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New Haven.
I got my Ph.D. from the University of Oregon under the supervision of Prof. Boyana Norris in 2019 with a dissertation on "Distributed Memory Processing of Very Large Graphs". 

<br>
<br>
My research interests includes big data processing and data mining. I've created GraphFlow, a workflow-based toolkit for processing big graphs.
